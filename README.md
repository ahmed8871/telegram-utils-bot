## Development

This project uses several tools to streamline the development process:

### mise

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is used for managing project-level dependencies and environment variables. mise helps
ensure consistent development environments across different machines.

To get started with mise:

1. Install mise by following the instructions on the [official website](https://mise.jdx.dev/).
2. Run `mise install` in the project root to set up the development environment.

### UV

[UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is used for dependency management and packaging. It provides a clean,
version-controlled way to manage project dependencies.

To set up the project with UV:

1. Install UV by following the instructions on the [official website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. Run `uv sync` to install project dependencies.

### Jurigged for Live Reload

[Jurigged](https://github.com/breuleux/jurigged) is used for live code reloading during development. This allows you to
see changes in your code immediately without manually restarting the application.

To use Jurigged:

1. Make sure you have installed the project dependencies using UV, including dev
   dependencies `uv sync --dev`.
2. Run the bot with Jurigged:

```bash
uv run jurigged -v -m src
```

## Internationalization (i18n)

- [Plate](https://github.com/delivrance/plate) library is used to translate the bot's messages.
- Translations are stored as JSON files in the `src/i18n/locales` directory, the default locale is `en_US`.
- To add a new language, create a new JSON file in the `src/i18n/locales` directory, with the corresponding language
  code, and translate the messages to that language.
- Set the `BOT_LANGUAGE` environment variable to the desired language code.
